    <p>A makeup artist is someone who uses cosmetic techniques and processes to create beauty upon the human body. In its simplest form, it enhances a person's appearance, bringing out color and features and hiding or smoothing out flaws, using cosmetic products. At its most extreme, makeup artistry creates imaginative characters and special effects for films, television, photography and theatre. </p>
<h2> SKIN CARE </h2>

<p>It’s not enough to have good skin-care products: For your products to be most effective, you also need to apply them in the correct order. Your routine will depend on your skin type, the ingredients and formulations of your products, and the time of day. A good rule of thumb, though, is to apply in order of texture, from thinnest to thickest, since thin products won’t be able to penetrate thicker ones.</p>
<h3>makeup product</h3>

<p> Every professional makeup artist favours a particular brand(s) but it is important to stay updated about the latest product launches as well. Some clients might have their own favourites when it comes to makeup brands, so an overall knowledge of the major makeup brands in the market is important. Also, makeup products vary from brand to brand. While some brand may excel in the quality of lipsticks, some may just be superb with their quality of foundations and eyeliners. So, choosing the best products from the best brands is always preferred over-relying on one brand.</p>
